    <h3> About Demarcus</h3>
    

    <p>While attending college, I've been able to gain a vast amount of IT experience. I started as a helpdesk representative working at ADT, AT&T, and Shands Hospital. Even though I also have a keen interest in IT in general, my real passion is programming. Putting together code that does what it is supposed to do brings me great joy. It is a skill you can never be too good at and, there is always something to learn. Outside of IT or programming, I enjoy playing video games and trying new things.</p>

    <p>As a student at Thinkful. I've begun my journey to becoming a software developer and couldn't be happier!</p>

    <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer please reach out! I am so excited to work with other developers to build great software.</p>
